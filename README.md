# 🔁 JavaScript Loops – Practice Assignments

This folder contains my dedicated practice work on **JavaScript loops**.  
Each program is focused on strengthening my understanding of the following concepts:

- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  
- `do...while` loop  
- Nested loops  
- Iterating over arrays & strings

## 📘 What This Folder Includes

Every file in this folder is based on a **specific logic-building problem using loops**, such as:

- Printing number sequences (even, odd, reverse, ranges, etc.)
- Calculating sums (for example, sum of `1 to N`)
- Finding the **factorial** of a number
- Generating **multiplication tables**
- Simple **pattern printing** using `*`
- Basic **array traversal** and small operations

> 📂 Each `.html` or `.js` file is an individual mini-assignment designed to sharpen loop logic and flow control.

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

You can run these programs using the following methods:

### 1️⃣ Using a Web Browser (HTML + JS)

1. Open any `.html` file from this folder.
2. Right-click → **Open with** → choose your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3. Open **Developer Tools → Console** (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`) to see the output.

---

### 2️⃣ Using Only the Browser Console

1. Open your browser.
2. Press `F12` and go to the **Console** tab.
3. Copy the JavaScript code from any `.js` file.
4. Paste it into the console and press **Enter**.

---

### 3️⃣ Using VS Code (Recommended)

1. Open this project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. (Optional) Install the **Live Server** extension.
3. Right-click on any `.html` file → select **Open with Live Server**.

## 🎯 Goal of This Practice Folder

The main goals of this folder are to:

- Build a **strong foundation** in JavaScript loops  
- Improve **logical thinking and problem-solving skills**
- Prepare for upcoming topics such as:
  - Arrays and Objects  
  - Functions and Algorithms  
  - Data Structures and Real-World Problems  

---

## 🚀 Planned Enhancements

In the future, I plan to:

- Add **step-by-step comments** in every program
- Include more **advanced loop-based challenges**, such as:
  - Number & star patterns  
  - Prime number programs  
  - Palindrome numbers and strings  
- Connect some programs with a **basic UI** using:
  - HTML input fields  
  - Buttons  
  - Live output display on the webpage

> This folder is not just a collection of programs — it is my **JavaScript Loop Logic Lab**, where I experiment, make mistakes, practice daily, and grow as a developer. 🚀
